This is the list of stuff I use to do my work and get other stuff done around the computer. If you want to see more lists like this, check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

## Hardware
I work on a ThinkPad T590 laptop with a USB-C dock and a dual monitor setup for when I'm in my office. I use a mechanical Das Keyboard Model S and a simple Logitech M500 mouse.

## Software

### OS
After a lifetime of being a predominantly Windows user I have recently switched over to Linux Mint as my daily driver and development environment and could not be happier. I still have  Windows 10 but I find myself booting to it only when I need to do .NET work or use Photoshop or Lightroom for my photos.

### Browser
I use Firefox. Not because it is better in any significant technical way than Chrome and other browsers (although it is not worse either), but because I am old enough to remember what a for-profit company being in control of a browser with over 90% market share brought us last time around. I believe in privacy and an open web. If this sort of stuff is important to you and you're on Chrome out of habit, [consider switching](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

### Design and Graphics
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) is probably the first piece of "real" software I learned to use
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for most of my UI design work
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) I don't use as much since moving to Figma, but it can be useful for rough mockups occasionally
- [Fontbase](https://fontba.se/) because I try to pretend I can keep my font collection in some kind of order
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for when I have to screw around wtih vectors 
- [Adobe Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) for managing and editing my photos
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is something I'm only starting to learn to use

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for messing around with APIs
- [MAMP Pro](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) as a local development environment for PHP/MySQL

### Utilites

- [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/) for backups
