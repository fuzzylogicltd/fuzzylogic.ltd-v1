This is the list of stuff I use to do my work and get other stuff done around the computer. If you want to see more lists like this, check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

## Hardware

My main machine these days is a MacBook Pro. I hook it up to a CalDigit dock and an external monitor.

## Software

### OS

I spent most of my life as a Windows user, then went to Linux (Mint) and then to MacOS. Each has it's own pros and cons. I enjoy the stability and overall smoothness and lack of fuss that Apple gives you. I don't miss the customizability of Linux as much as I thought I would, but what I do miss is the warm feeling in my heart that running an open-source OS gives you.

### Browser

I use Firefox. Not because it is better in any significant technical way than Chrome and other browsers (although it is not worse either), but because I am old enough to remember what a for-profit company being in control of a browser with over 90% market share brought us last time around. I believe in privacy and an open web. If this sort of stuff is important to you and you're on Chrome out of habit, [consider switching](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

I don't use very many plugins, but the few that are essential to me are: uBlock Origin, Vimium, Wappalyzer, React Developer Tools and Redux DevTools

### IDE

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the majority of my coding
- My font is Fira Code, I use Material Theme and Icons
- Plugins: GitLens, Live Server, Prettier, ES Lint are the general ones I'd recommend, all the other ones are technology-specific.
- And yes, I have GitHub Copilot, it's... occasionally useful.

### Terminal

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my terminal
- Zsh is my shell with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (I'm very vanilla in my choices as you can see)
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) as a _cd_ replacement. [Here's a video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aghxkpyRVDY). Trust me.

### Other Dev Stuff

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for messing around with APIs
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for working with databases
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for docking

### Design and Graphics

- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) is probably the first piece of "real" software I learned to use
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for most of my UI design work
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for when I have to screw around wtih vectors
- [Adobe Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) for managing and editing my photos
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for brainstorming color schemes (online tool)

### Utilites/Productivity

- [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) for time tracking
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for long term storage of information
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) for keeping notes (it replaced Evernote for me but it's kinda clunky honestly)
- [CommanderOne](https://www.electronic.us/products/commander-one/) I'm still a two-pane Total Commander geek. Sorry

### Media

- [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) for streaming my own music. I hate the whole music-as-a-service Spotify thing
- [VLC Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) for video
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for ebooks that I can then toss onto my Kindle
- [YACReader](https://www.yacreader.com/) for comics
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) for keeping up with RSS feeds
